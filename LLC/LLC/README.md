### Tech Stack :muscle:

- Blazor WebAssembly 5.0 - ASP.NET Core Hosted Model
- [Entity Framework Core 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)

# BlazorHero v2.1

- minor bug fixes
- UI improvements
- validation messages fixed
- fluent validation support

# Getting Started 🦸

> **Important**
If you are already using Blazor Hero v1.x, make sure that you drop your existing database and re-update your database using the CLI as there are couple of new migrations added that may clash with your existing schema. Also, install the latest version of BlazorHero.

The easiest way to get started with Blazor Hero is to install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LLC/) and run `dotnet new LLC`:

1. Install the latest [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
2. Install the latest DOTNET & EF CLI Tools by using this command `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` 
3. Install the latest version of Visual Studio IDE 2019 (v16.8 and above) 🚀
4. Open up Command Prompt and run `dotnet new --install LLC` to install the project template
5. Create a folder for your solution and cd into it (the template will use it as project name)
6. Run `dotnet new LLC` to create a new Solution with all the Awesomeness 🕶️ of BlazorHero 🦸

Here are the few contributions that I would highly appreciate ;)

- [ ] Need someone to add in the API Documentation for Swagger.
- [ ] Need someone to implement localization throughout every Razor Component of the solution under the WASM(Client) Project. You can take the Pages/Authentication/Login.razor as the point of reference. It is as simple as adding `@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.IStringLocalizer<Login> localizer` to every page, changing the texts to `@localizer["Text Here"]` and finally adding resx files to the Resources Folder as per the folder structure.
- [ ] Need few contributors to add in various language transalations as per the implemented Location. I got time to only add a few transalations for French as of now.
- [ ] Need a UI contributor to look at the UX/UI of the entire project
- [ ] Need someone to buildup a cool Material Logo for BlazorHero (BH):D Do contact me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/iammukeshm/).
- [ ] And finally, Stars from everyone! :D
